# Maze

A script that generates a random maze using python. 
Also includes a short script to render the maze with pygame.

## Dependencies

The script to generate the algorithm for the maze uses two standard modules: random and sys, and a third: pygame, that is used to help develop games with the python language.

Pygame can be installed with pip from your terminal or cmd prompt by typing `pip3 install pygame`.

The pygame module then helps render a visual representation of the generated maze, such as the one below.
